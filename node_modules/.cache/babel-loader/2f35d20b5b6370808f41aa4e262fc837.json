People were more stressed, comparing their lives to others on social media, and allowing work to overtake more and more of the work-life balance. Enter Chubbies - our visceral and irreverent response to all of the above. We launched in September of 2011 and were sold out for 2+ years of our core casual shorts product. In the subsequent years we launched swim trunks, aloha shirts, sport shorts, lounge shorts, performance polos, t-shirts, hoodies, jackets, and quarter to round out the year-round Weekend Wardrobe. Throughout, we maintained a consistent focus on building the perfect product for your Weekend, and wove every piece of fabric around that objective. Now, we are proud to say we have the most well-rounded, custom-built-for-the-weekend apparel on the planet and, not only that, a brand built by, and for, our community and 100% centered on that Friday at 5pm feeling.\"), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"dev\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 21,\n      columnNumber: 221\n    }\n  }), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"dev\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 22,\n      columnNumber: 1\n    }\n  }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"img\", {\n    src: \"https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2F49b06ef06b5f4cac868ef1f5e4ca7b5f%2F06d8ad30144749fca31af2c9d5d16abe?format=webp&width=2000\",\n    alt: \"Logo\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 22,\n      columnNumber: 6\n    }\n  })));\n};\n\nexport default About;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["D:/ReactVSCODE/ShopApp-master/src/components/about.js"],"names":["React","About"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;;AAEA,MAAMC,KAAK,GAAG,MAAM;AAClB,sBACE,uDACD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBADC,eAED;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IAFC,eAEU;AAAG,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,4+DAFV,eAgBwN;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IAhBxN,eAiBJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAAK;AAAK,IAAA,GAAG,EAAE,yIAAV;AAAqJ,IAAA,GAAG,EAAC,MAAzJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IAAL,CAjBI,CADF;AAqBD,CAtBD;;AAwBA,eAAeA,KAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\";\n\nconst About = () => {\n  return (\n    <>\n   <h1>Who are we ?</h1>\n   <dev></dev><p className=\"text-left\">Chubbies was founded in 2011 by a group of friends who found the traditional world of men’s capital-F-”Fashion” completely unrelatable.
